Map-based Web Application Examples
Data Sources

## Software
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [GitHub's Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Supplimentary Resources

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - A highly authoritative body of documentation on Javascript and many other web development topics.
* [Introduction to Web Mapping](http://132.72.155.230:3838/js/index.html) - A web-based text book specifically for JavaScript-based mapping. A good portion of this class will overlap with the material in this book.
* [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) - A set of free online books which start from scratch and go, in-depth, into javascript concepts and best practices.
* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) - This is a free book with some _advanced_ content. As you think about the application you might like to build for your final, the chapters on HTML forms, drawing with javascript, building a game, and constructing your own painting application will push further than we can in class.

## Objectives

* Gain familiarity and comfort with the JavaScript language (and, as necessary, HTML and CSS)
* Gain familiarity with "tools of the trade", such as code editors, git and GitHub
* Understand the structure of client-side web applications built in JavaScript, especially:
  * How web browsers load resources from the web
  * How web browsers respond to user interaction
* Know how to use mapping libraries like [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html), along with some of its various plugins
* Know how to work with data in JavaScript, including understanding the limits of client-side data processing

## Course Outline

Throughout this 15 week course, you'll be learning to program applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In addition to programming skills, we will stress the "tools of the trade": you will use a text editor designed for programming; your code will be turned in with git and managed through github. You will be programming in the same way and with some of the same tools as software developers in the industry.

We'd like to keep the course somewhat freeform — there are basic skills which must be touched on, but your interests will help shape the direction to a large extent. There will be a self-directed final assignment that can take on about any topic you find interesting (so long as you use tools from our class).

This syllabus is a living document. As the course progresses, greater detail will be added to reflect the content of each week.

* Assessment Method / Grading Criteria:
  * Participation and attendance: 25%
  * Exercises and assignments: 25%
  * Final Project Proposal: 10%
  * Final Project:  40%

### Exercises and Assignments

* You’ll have a _SHORT_ assignment almost every class, at least for the first half of the semester
* Assignments will be submitted via pull request on GitHub
* Most assignments will be checked automatically when you submit; you can always tweak until it works

### Final project

The final assignment for the class will be decided through a project proposal. Final projects will be done in groups or independently — criteria for success will be hammered out in the final project proposal and group projects (if we have any) will be expected to engage with a wider scope and greater difficulty than individual projects. Group projects will also leverage the power of GitHub to make collaboration simpler and more transparent for grading purposes (this will make more sense once you're familiar with GitHub).

## Academic Integrity

In compliance with Penn's [Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/ai_codeofacademicintegrity.html), blatantly and egregiously copying another student's work will not be tolerated. However, because this course is designed to help prepare students for work in professional programming environments, *copying and pasting is not universally prohibited*: we encourage students to work together and to freely use the internet as a resource for finding solutions to vexing problems. Citing every copied and pasted line of code is *not* necessary. Large patterns or multiple lines of code taken from external sources *should*, however, be noted with in-code comments. If an instance is unclear, you should feel free to speak with the instructors.
